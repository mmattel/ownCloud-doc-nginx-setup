Compared to the original implementation where gzip is set to off,
I have made good experiences with gzip on.
The related issues are older and fixed in the meanwhile.

Issue 1: Default nginx.conf leaves sites vulnerable to BREACH
Fixed  : nginx/1.9.1-1

Issue 2: Missing etag when gzip is used
Fixed  : nginx/1.7.3
Text   : Weak entity tags are now preserved on response modifications,
         and strong ones are changed to weak
